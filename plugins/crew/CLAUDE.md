# crew — quick reference for agents working on this plugin

Crew-specific map. **Keep it accurate: a PR that changes anything stated here updates this file
in the same commit.** Rules shared by every plugin: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

## Map

- `agents/` — auto-discovered, not in the manifest.
  - `morpheus`: orchestrator, `model: opus`, sole git owner. Its `Agent(...)` allowlist (eight
    workers plus `Explore`/`Plan`) and `ExitPlanMode` only work as the main thread of
    `claude --agent crew:morpheus`; via `/crew:feature` the harness ignores both. It also has
    `AskUserQuestion` (operator choices), `TaskStop`, `Skill`, `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`;
    workers get no web tools.
  - Workers: `tank` (the stack's core: in a CLI or script pack, the commands and I/O), `trinity`
    (client-facing layer), `oracle` (unit tests), `dozer` (e2e), `seraph` (visual, no Bash;
    measures computed styles through the browser MCP), `neo` (express generalist), `sentinel`
    (post-merge triage; no Write/Edit/Bash, history via the git-host MCP), `keymaker` (debt
    scout; no Write/Edit/Bash — `Grep`/`Glob` only, so `/crew:audit` hands it `diff` and
    `outdated` results as data).
- `commands/` — namespaced `crew:*` when installed.
  - `init` writes `.claude/crew.md`, one frontmatter key per slot, the only config location.
    Its §1 slot keys are validator §11's source of truth (the `- **Slot** (`key`) —` bullet
    shape is what §11 parses); §2 takes each backend's commands from its `backend-<stack>`
    skill's *Crew config* section; §3 owns what may go in `CLAUDE.md` (auto mode's classifier
    reads only that file); §5 writes and reconciles; §6 reports MCP namespaces.
  - `feature`, `review` (GO/NO-GO gate), `pr` (the only push/PR path), `address`.
  - `debt`: routes into `morpheus`'s debt lane (the `debt-lane` skill), in the foreground so its
    gates can prompt. The skill must not share a command's name: a command is also listed as a
    skill, so `morpheus` would load the command and relaunch itself.
  - `audit`: launches `keymaker` (`diff`'s file list and `outdated`'s package-manager output are
    resolved here first — the scout has no Bash), relays the report, then launches `morpheus`
    directly per picked pointer with `debt`'s open-mode instructions, never by nesting
    `/crew:debt`.
  - `loop`: re-launches `morpheus` directly each tick on native `/loop` until exit conditions or
    the cap; the wrapper owns scheduling.
  - `triage`: launches `sentinel` and relays its report; writes nothing (#175 phase 2).
  - `notify`: peer-session messaging (#177). A command, since `morpheus` has no `ListAgents`, so
    a `--agent crew:morpheus` session needs an explicit `to=`.
- `skills/` — `<name>/SKILL.md`, frontmatter `name:` + `description:` only (the description
  carries the triggers).
  - `morpheus`'s preloads: `context-discipline`, `loop-engineering`, `operator-voice`
    (ASD-STE-100; operator messages only, never plans, ledgers or commits), `review-gate` (the
    build/test/lint gate rules; `/crew:review` loads it too, since a standalone run never sees
    `morpheus.md`).
  - Debt lane, loaded on demand: `debt-lane` (open mode — the flow, the fixer rules each handoff
    carries, the `<plan-dir>/debt-<slug>.md` ledger with its per-batch `snapshot:`),
    `debt-taxonomy` (rubric, gate, tiers), and `debt-taxonomy-dotnet`/`-typescript`
    (mechanisms, justification slots, recipes). `keymaker` loads the taxonomy skills too; the
    audit flow lives in its own prompt.
  - Also: `engineering-principles` (the code rules `/crew:review` grades a user's project
    against; this repo's own review rubric is `.github/skills/code-review`), and the preloads
    `worker-contract` (the rules shared by the five workers with a shell — `tank`, `trinity`,
    `oracle`, `dozer`, `neo` — so each prompt states only what is specific to its role, and each
    stack skill only what is specific to its tool: watch commands, weakening flags, the lock
    signature, filter and discovery syntax, the skip mechanism),
    `mid-run-direction` (all eight workers, not `morpheus`) and `design-tokens` (`seraph`).
  - Loaded once resolved: frontend mode, stack and test-tool skills. Backends `backend-dotnet`
    (+ `cms-optimizely`), `-node`, `-python`, `-go`, `-rust`, `-java`, `-shell`, each paired with
    a `tests-*` skill. Only node needs lane paths (its extensions collide with a frontend's).
    `frontendStack: none` is a stated absence: `morpheus` skips frontend, e2e and unit-tool
    resolution and dispatches only `tank`/`oracle`. That gate sits above the resolution table.
- `hooks/` — wired in `hooks/hooks.json`, the one copy; in this repo they load through
  `claude --plugin-dir plugins/crew`. `bash-safety` and `lane-guard` fail closed; `read-guard`, `format`,
  `dispatch-denied` and `plan-guard` fail open.
  - `bash-safety.sh`: workers run no git but a plain `git mv`; protected-branch commit backstop (reads the
    payload's `cwd`, not the hook's directory; AGENTS.md has the shapes); watch/dev
    commands refused; file-mutating Bash refused for agent sessions (in-place
    `sed`/`perl`/`ruby`/`awk`, `tee`, `patch`, `cp`/`mv`, a redirect to a non-exempt sink; #192).
    One carve-out: a plain `git mv`, for any agent, matched on the raw command so a later line
    counts; `-f`/`--force` stays refused. The no-git arm checks `guard_strip_git_mv`'s copy of
    the command, so a worker's plain `git mv` passes and any other git beside it is refused.
    Raw reads (`cat f`) are refused for agent sessions: a habit redirect, not a boundary.
    Pagers and `tail -f` are refused for every session, since they never end.
  - `read-guard.sh`: raw reads over 64 KiB; an explicit `limit` ≤ 2000 lines passes.
  - `lane-guard.sh`: Edit/Write lanes. `morpheus` is `--allow` on a filename shape at any depth —
    `plan-*.md`, `debt-*.md`, `crew.md`, `agent-memory-local/*.md` — plus scratch; no directory to
    anchor, no plan-directory slot read (AGENTS.md, "Why `morpheus` is lane-guarded"). The
    four lane workers get their lanes below. A `..` segment is refused for every lane agent.
    The only hook that reads crew config: `.claude/crew.md` frontmatter by key, nothing else.
    Loaded once in the parent shell, since `config_slot` runs in `$(...)`.
  - Roster shape: `# crew-roster: <name>` then an `a|b|c)` arm, in `bash-safety.sh` and
    `lane-guard.sh`; §9 keeps both in lockstep with `owns-git`/`lane-guarded` frontmatter.
  - `format.sh`: six lanes by extension, each under `CREW_FORMAT_TIMEOUT` (default 20s,
    unbounded without `timeout`/`gtimeout`). `dotnet`/`web` use project tools and root config
    only (a nested `.prettierrc` is missed); `python`/`go`/`rust`/`java` use `PATH` tools and
    `find_up` config bounded at the project root. `.sh`/`.bats` are unowned. Single-file
    formatters only; whole-project ones belong to the review gate.
  - `dispatch-denied.sh` (`PermissionDenied`, `Agent|Task`): attempt 1 emits `retry: true`,
    later ones only a `systemMessage`. The JSON is the decision. Counter under
    `CREW_DISPATCH_DENIED_DIR`; a path that cannot count takes the no-retry branch. Gates on the
    `crew:` namespace, not a roster.
  - `plan-guard.sh` (`PreToolUse`, `Agent|Task`): in plan mode, refuses a `crew:<worker>` whose
    frontmatter grants `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit`; `owns-git: true` passes. Reads both
    `tools:` shapes; `CREW_AGENTS_DIR` is the test override.
  - `lib/guard-lib.sh`: payload plumbing, `guard_normalize`, `GUARD_RE_*`, the `guard_block_*`
    helpers, quote masking, protected branches, read-guard limits, state files.
- `tests/` — a guard is `stdin JSON → exit 0/2`: assert allow/block plus a stderr substring.
  Exceptions: `format` asserts its stderr
  report through fake tools, `dispatch-denied` asserts its stdout JSON with `jq`, and
  `plan-guard` uses real agents, then fixtures via `CREW_AGENTS_DIR`. Every validator section has
  a negative fixture and a silent control (assert on the FAIL message).
  `changelog-gate.test.sh` builds real git history.

## Schemas & conventions

- Durable run state: `<plan-dir>/plan-<feature>.md`, schema in `agents/morpheus.md`
  §"The plan file is durable state" — header `feature:`/`base-branch:`/`feature-branch:` +
  inner-loop fields (`loop:`, `exit-conditions:`, `gate:`) + outer-loop bookkeeping
  (`iterations: n/max`, written by the `/crew:loop` wrapper, not morpheus);
  steps carry `id:`/`status:`/`depends-on:`/`acceptance:`/`worker:`/`attempts:`/`evidence:`, plus
  `agent-id:` while in flight (cleared when the step leaves `in-progress`). The `steer-token:`
  **never** lands in the plan file, since a plan dir can be committed; a resumed run
  re-dispatches instead of steering orphans.
- Loop mode: generic contract in the shared `loop-engineering` skill; crew bindings (gate GO
  success, second-NO-GO cap, `/crew:pr`, neo no-op) in `agents/morpheus.md` §"Loop-mode
  bindings". The outer loop is `commands/loop.md`.
- Every crew agent carries `owns-git` and `lane-guarded` before `skills:` (§9); exactly one
  (`morpheus`) owns git.
- `omitClaudeMd: true` only on `sentinel` and `seraph` (read-only, fully briefed). Never on an
  implementer: the project's `CLAUDE.md` holds its conventions. Not on `keymaker` either: the
  project's `CLAUDE.md` may carry the debt policy section it has to honor.
- `morpheus` has `loaded-lines-cap: 609`, 4 lines of slack (raised from 595 when the gate rules
  moved into the preloaded `review-gate` skill, whose frontmatter and heading count). Skills it
  loads on demand (`debt-lane`) do not count.

## Gotchas

- `lane-guard.sh`'s `scan_markers` uses hardcoded framework allowlists
  (`node_backend_deps`/`frontend_deps`, only when stacks and lane paths are unset). A miss fails
  silently, so add new frameworks **with a fixture in `tests/lane-guard.test.sh`**. One `find`
  walk for all markers; `detect_regime` caches per `session_id`, published by `mv`.
- `sentinel`'s "no mutating MCP tool" rule is prose, not a mechanism (§13 forces whole-server
  grants). Don't describe it as enforced.
