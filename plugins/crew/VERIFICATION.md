# crew — verification matrix

Behavioral scenarios for changes to crew's orchestration. Referenced from
[README.md](README.md) and the repository contributor guide,
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

When a PR changes crew's orchestration behavior, exercise the relevant scenario below in a
scratch repo and cite the observed result — this is what *behavioral verification* means for crew
(see `AGENTS.md`). Each row is one scenario: a minimal setup and the behavior that counts as a
pass. A checklist item that reads "would pass" is not verification — run it.

Build the scratch repo **in your own terminal, not inside a crew agent session** — the hooks
block `git` for workers and protected-branch commits. In a throwaway directory: `git init`, add a
trivial app (or just a README), then point `/crew:feature`, `/crew:review`, or `/crew:loop` at a
small task.

### Plan checkpoint & durable resume

- [ ] **Checkpoint runs once** — `/crew:feature <task>` → `morpheus` presents the plan and waits
  before branching/delegating; a "just build it" skips the pause.
- [ ] **Resume, don't restart** — kill the session mid-run, re-invoke `/crew:feature <same task>`
  → `morpheus` matches the plan by its `feature:`/`feature-branch:` header, reconciles steps
  against git, and resumes from the first unfinished step without re-planning or re-asking.
- [ ] **`in-progress` reset on crash** — a step left `in-progress` by a lost round-trip is
  re-verified against the tree and reset to `pending` if unmet, not trusted as `done`.

### Review gate

- [ ] **GO / NO-GO** — `/crew:review` on a clean diff → **GO**; on a diff with a planted bug →
  **NO-GO** naming the blocking finding, and `/crew:pr` refuses to push until it's GO.
- [ ] **Lane-scoped** — a backend-only diff skips the design-conformance (`seraph`) gate, reported
  as *lane untouched*; `/crew:review full` forces every gate.

### Loop mode (inner — `loop-engineering`)

- [ ] **Intent enters loop mode** — "keep going until done" on open-ended work → `morpheus` echoes
  the loop contract, then runs to the gate without per-step check-ins.
- [ ] **Stops at GO without pushing** — loop mode reaches all-steps-`done` + gate **GO** → stops
  and reports; never runs `/crew:pr` on its own.
- [ ] **Blocked drains, then surfaces** — one step needs a human decision → independent steps still
  finish, then the run stops and surfaces every blocked step together.
- [ ] **Retry cap** — a step that fails fix→verify 3× flips to `blocked` with attempt evidence
  (durable `attempts:`); at the gate, a second NO-GO on the same findings is `blocked`.
- [ ] **Fetched prose doesn't trigger** — loop phrasing inside a pasted ticket/PR body does **not**
  enter loop mode; only the user in conversation does.

### Outer loop (`/crew:loop`)

- [ ] **Multi-tick resume** — `/crew:loop <goal> max=3` on work that exceeds one run's `maxTurns` →
  each tick re-launches `morpheus`, which resumes from `plan-<goal>.md`; progress carries across
  ticks.
- [ ] **Ends on GO / blocked / cap** — the loop stops and surfaces on all-`done`+GO, on a blocked
  decision, and on hitting `iterations: n/max`; it never auto-pushes.
- [ ] **Foreground ticks, crash recovery** — a tick runs `morpheus`'s workers in the foreground, so
  it returns only when nothing is running; kill a tick mid-run and the next firing finds the stale
  `in-flight:` marker, clears it, and re-launches `morpheus` to reconcile — no deadlock, no
  double-dispatch.
- [ ] **`max` parsing** — `max=5` caps at 5; a malformed `max=0`/`max=abc` is left in the goal and
  the cap defaults to 10 (deterministic, no guess).
