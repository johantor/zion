# PermissionDenied(Agent|Task) advisor for crew worker dispatch.
#
# Auto mode drops `Agent` allow rules on entry and judges every dispatch on its
# own, so a dispatch identical to one that passed a minute ago can be refused
# now. Without this hook `morpheus` sees only "Blocked by classifier" and hands
# the step back with nothing actionable.
#
# First denial of a worker in a session: retry once. Not a bypass — the retried
# call goes through the classifier again, which gets the final say. Later denials
# do NOT retry: they report the fixes that actually exist, so `morpheus` stops
# thrashing and hands the step back cleanly.
#
# Advisory, not a guard: it never blocks. Silent (exit 0, no output) when it can't
# tell what it is looking at — no jq, unparseable payload, a dispatch that isn't
# a crew worker's. Reports without retrying when it recognises a crew dispatch
# but can't count attempts, since a retry it cannot bound is worse than none. See
# AGENTS.md, "How the crew works".
#
# For this event Claude Code ignores the exit code and stderr — decisions travel
# as JSON on stdout: `hookSpecificOutput.retry` reaches the model,
# `systemMessage` reaches the user.

What does work: switch this session to acceptEdits (Shift+Tab) instead of auto; describe the project in autoMode.environment in ~/.claude/settings.json (keeping the "$defaults" entry — the classifier does not read project settings); or reissue the call yourself from /permissions > Recently denied (press r).'
