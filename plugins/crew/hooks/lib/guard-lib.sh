# patterns the Bash guard enforces, and per-session state files.

# Sourced, never executed, and wired in no hooks.json -- validator §6 wires only
# the top-level hooks/*.sh entry points.
#
# Two rules shape everything below.
#
# 1. No forks on the hot path -- PreToolUse(Bash) runs before *every* Bash tool
#    call. Matching uses bash's own =~ and parameter expansion, and the single
#    `jq` that parses the payload is the only child a guard spawns. Patterns stay
#    POSIX (`[[:space:]]`, never the GNU-only `\s`) for BSD/macOS regcomp.
# 2. The caller owns the failure posture: security guards source this file
#    fail-closed, context/advisory hooks fail-open. The guard_block_* helpers are
#    the exception -- they exist to block.

# shellcheck disable=SC2034
# ^ GUARD_* and guard_* are this library's public surface. shellcheck cannot

# Idempotent: two hooks in one process (or a re-source) must not redefine state.
