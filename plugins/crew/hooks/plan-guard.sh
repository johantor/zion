# Plan-mode dispatch guard: while the session is in plan mode, refuse to launch
# a crew worker that edits files.
#
# Plan mode refuses every Edit/Write until the plan is approved, so an
# implementer dispatched during planning spends its turns on refused edits and
# hands back nothing. The worker's own frontmatter decides, not a roster (the
# rosters validator §9 pins live in bash-safety/lane-guard; a third one here
# would drift unwatched): `owns-git: true` marks the orchestrator, which plans
# in plan mode and passes; any other crew agent whose `tools:` carry
# Edit/Write/NotebookEdit is refused until the plan is approved; a worker with
# none of those passes.
#
# A fast-fail, not a boundary: plan mode itself is what blocks the edits. So it
# FAILS OPEN — no jq, an unparseable payload, a dispatch that isn't a crew
# worker's, an agent file it can't find — all allow. Inert under this repo's own
# dev wiring, where nothing dispatches namespaced agents (as dispatch-denied).
# See plugins/crew/CLAUDE.md and the README's "Plan mode".
