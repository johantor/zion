# Behavior tests for dispatch-denied.sh — the PermissionDenied advisor that
# reacts to auto mode refusing a crew worker dispatch. Two shapes set it apart
# from the guards: its decision is JSON on _stdout (the event ignores exit codes
# and stderr), and it is stateful, counting attempts per session+worker through
# the CREW_DISPATCH_DENIED_DIR override. Like turn-budget.sh it is advisory, but
# it degrades in two directions, and the cases below pin both: silent when it
# can't tell what it is looking at (unparseable payload, a dispatch that isn't a
# crew worker's), and reporting-without-retrying when it recognises a crew
# dispatch but can't count attempts (no session key, unwritable state).
#
# The load-bearing asymmetry: only a counted first attempt may ask for a retry.
# Everything after it, and every path where the counter can't be trusted, must
# not — and a can't-count message must not claim to be a repeat.
