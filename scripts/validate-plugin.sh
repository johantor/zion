# 14. Frontmatter parses as YAML. A plain (unquoted) scalar cannot contain a
#     colon followed by whitespace: YAML reads it as a nested mapping, the whole
#     block fails to load, and a loader then sees an agent, command or skill with
#     no `name` and no `description` at all. Prose descriptions fall into this
#     naturally -- "Read-only: it investigates and reports" is the shape -- and
#     the file still looks right, so nothing about the failure is visible while
#     authoring. No other section here catches it either: they all read
#     frontmatter key by key with awk rather than parsing the block.
#
#     Targeted rather than a real parse: this repo ships no YAML dependency, and
#     the colon trap is the whole class that a hand-written description hits. A
#     value that opens with a quote, a block scalar (`|`, `>`), a flow collection
#     or an anchor/tag indicator has already declared its type, so it is left to
#     YAML's own rules.
